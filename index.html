          <h3>Hey there, friend!</h3>
          <br><br> It looks like you're trying to view some pictures! Though instead you've stumbled across my little corner of the web.
          <br><br>
          While you're here, I wanted to give you a heads up about something interesting and a tad bit concerning. You know how website addresses have those endings like <code>.com</code>, <code>.org</code>, or <code>.net</code>? Well, it seems like our <i>lord and saviour</i> Google have released a new one - <code>.zip</code>. Now, before you get all excited, there are a few things we need to talk about.
          <br><br>
          Whenever new top-level domains pop up, there's a potential for trouble. And in this case, it's no different. It could even be one of the biggest upsets to the internet in a while!
          <br><br>
          With this new .zip domain, hackers, scammers and other bad actors can very easily create fake websites which look like very real folders you'd like to download. Perhaps <code>documents.zip</code> or <code>invoices.zip</code> - or even just a nice email from your friends and family containing <code>holidayphotos.zip</code>.
          <br><br>
          You should never, <b><i>under any circumstances</i></b> open a <code>.zip</code> link that you don't know - but now that a <code>.zip</code> link could open up a strange new website, those bad actors I mentioned could get some nasty virus on your computer to download automatically. 
          <br><br>
          Now, I don't want to scare you, but we've got to be careful. So, here are a few tips to keep in mind:
            <br><br>
          </div>
          
          <ul>
            <li><b>Stay vigilant and double-check things:</b> If you come across a website or get an email with a <code>.zip</code> domain, take a moment to think. Is it from a trustworthy source? Does everything look and feel legit? If something seems off, trust your gut and don't take any risks.</li>
<br>
<li><b>Make sure you've got some solid security measures in place:</b> Install antivirus and anti-malware software on your devices. These tools can help sniff out and block any potential threats. Keep your operating system and apps updated too. Those updates often patch up security holes and keep the bad guys out.</li>
<br>  
<li><b>Spread the word!</b> Share this info with your friends and family. Let them know about the risks associated with opening unfamiliar links or attachments, especially those from sketchy sources. Together, we can keep each other safe and sound.</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="text-center ">
                    <br><br>
                    <hr>
My personal opinion? They've done this on purpose. It's no coincidence that they just released <code>.mov</code> at the same time - by tanking the trustworthiness of <code>.zip</code> and <code>.mov</code> links, so tanks the trustworthiness of these filetypes - filetypes which just so happen to be among the most commonly pirated.
<br><br>
But that's just my opinion. Stay safe, and trust no link!
